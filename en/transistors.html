            The first patent for a field-effect transistor was granted in 1925 in Canada to Julius Edgar Lilienfeld, a native of Lviv. However, he did not publish any research related to his invention. In 1934, German physicist Oscar Heil patented another field-effect transistor. In 1947, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain from AT&T Bell Labs discovered the amplification effect in a germanium crystal. William Shockley saw significant potential in this phenomenon. Due to his own work on this new phenomenon, he can be considered the father of the transistor. The term "transistor" was proposed by John Pierce.
            <br>
            In 1956, Bardeen, Shockley, and Brattain received the Nobel Prize for the invention of the transistor.

            The first silicon transistor was produced by Texas Instruments in 1954. This was achieved by Gordon Teal, a specialist in growing high-purity crystals who had previously worked at Bell Labs. The first MOS transistor was created by Kang and Atalla at Bell Labs in 1960.
            <br>
            In the 1950s and 1960s, transistors quickly replaced vacuum tubes in nearly all areas of application due to their compactness, technological advantages, durability, and ability to integrate into large and super-large electronic circuits.
