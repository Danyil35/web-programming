                <strong>IBM PC</strong> - 1981
                <br>
                <p>
                    The IBM PC, introduced on August 12, 1981, is considered one of the most significant milestones in the history of personal computers. Its official name was IBM 5150, and this computer became the foundation for the PC standard that was actively used and developed in the following decades. The IBM PC established standards that became the basis for subsequent models, including compatibility with hardware and software solutions. This facilitated the creation of a vast array of software and accessories for PCs, as well as the emergence of numerous clones and compatible computers from other manufacturers.

                <strong>Apple Macintosh</strong> - 1984
                <br>
                <p>
                    The Apple Macintosh was announced on January 24, 1984, and became the first personal computer to offer a graphical user interface (GUI) and a mouse as standard input devices. This computer showcased a new approach to interacting with computers, significantly simplifying their use. The Macintosh was revolutionary due to its graphical interface, which included windows, icons, and menus, making computers more accessible to non-professional users. This contributed to the popularization of GUIs and later developments in the field of personal computers.
